# pokemon
This is a pokemon clone I created a while ago. It has some unfinished elements (like the money and buying features), but it is a playable game. Level up your pokemon, catch more pokemon, beat the trainers blocking your path and see if you can make it to the last level. Just be advised that there is no victory condition.
Move with the arrow keys, activate things with SPACE and save your progress with Ctrl-S.

Note:
The game will save your progress in C:\PokemonSaveData unless you change this in the code.
